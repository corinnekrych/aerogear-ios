/**
AGAuthzModule represents an OAuth2 module and provides an interface for managing OAuth2 dance. The
default implementation uses REST as the authz transport. Similar to the [Pipe](AGPipe), technical details of the
underlying system are not exposed.

## Login

Once you have a _valid_ user you can use that information to issue a login against the server, to start accessing
protected endpoints:

    AGAuthorizer* authorizer = [AGAuthorizer authorizer];

    _restAuthzModule = [authorizer authz:^(id<AGAuthzConfig> config) {
        config.name = @"restAuthMod";
        config.baseURL = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:@"https://accounts.google.com"];
        config.authzEndpoint = @"/o/oauth2/auth";
        config.accessTokenEndpoint = @"/o/oauth2/token";
        config.clientId = @"XXXXXXX";
        config.clientSecret = @"XXXXXXX";
        config.redirectURL = @"org.aerogear.GoogleDrive:/oauth2Callback";
        config.scopes = @[@"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"];
    }];

    [_restAuthzModule requestAccessSuccess:^(id object) {
       // object contain the access token needed to query exposed web service
       // You can use ipe as usual
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        // an error occurred
    }];
}

The ```requestAccess:success:failure:``` function deal with the OAuth dance. To manage callback to application,
the AeroGear uses URL scheme. Schema should be carefully defined in you plist application.

## Time out and Cancel pending operations

As with the case of Pipe, configured timeout interval (in the config object) and cancel operation in
_AGAuthenticationModule_ is supported too.
