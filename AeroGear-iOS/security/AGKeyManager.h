/**
 AGKeyManager manages different AGEncryptionService implementations. It is basically a
 factory that hides the concrete instantiations of a specific AGEncryptionService implementation.
 
 ## Example usage
 
 Here is an example usage of retrieving an encryption service (based on PBKDF2) and assigning to a data store to provide
 on-the fly encryption and decryption of data:
 
     // randomly generate salt
     NSData *salt = [AGRandomGenerator randomBytes];  // [1]
 
     // set up crypto params configuration object
     AGPassphraseCryptoConfig *config = [[AGPassphraseCryptoConfig alloc] init];  // [2]
     [config setSalt:salt];  // [3]
     [config setPassphrase:self.password.text];   // [4]
 
     // initialize the encryption service passing the config
     id<AGEncryptionService> encService = [[AGKeyManager manager] keyService:config];  // [5]
 
     // access Store Manager
     AGDataManager *manager = [AGDataManager manager];  // [6]
 
     // create store
     store = [manager store:^(id<AGStoreConfig> config) {
         [config setName:@"CredentialsStorage"];
         [config setType:@"ENCRYPTED_PLIST"];  // [7]
         [config setEncryptionService:encService];  // [8]
     }];
 
     // ok time to attempt reading..
     NSArray *data = [store readAll]) { // [9]
 
     if (data)
        // decryption succeeded!
 
 In [1] we initialize a random salt that will be used in the encryption. In [2] we initialize an instance of a
 CryptoConfig configuration object to set our crypto params. Here we use an PassphraseCryptoConfig object, that sets
 the necessary crypto params for the PBKDF2 Encryption Service, mainly the salt [3] and the passphrase [4].
 
 Now that we have setup the configuration, it’s time to obtain an instance of an EncryptionService and that’s exactly
 what we do in [5]. KeyManager parses the configuration and returns an instance of it. Because we passed an
 PassphraseCryptoConfig object, a PBKDF2 encryption service would be returned.
 
 In [6] we initialize our data store (an encrypted plist [7]), setting the encryption service we obtained earlier [8].
 Reading and saving operations are done like all the other stores, but this time the data are transparently
 encrypted/decrypted.
 
 In [9] we attempt to read data from the store. If that fails, then user supplied wrong crypto parameters
 (either passphrase or salt).
